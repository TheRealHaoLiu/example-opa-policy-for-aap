# 2. Preventing Job Execution by `superuser`

## Overview

In this example, we'll demonstrate how to use Ansible Automation Platform to create a policy that makes decisions based on who is launching a job, specifically blocking execution if it is initiated by a superuser such as a platform administrator. 

## Example Policy [aap_policy_examples/superuser_allowed_false.rego](aap_policy_examples/superuser_allowed_false.rego):

The following policy (`aap_policy_examples/superuser_allowed_false.rego`) prevents a superuser from launching jobs:

```rego
package aap_policy_examples

import rego.v1

violations contains msg if {
	input.created_by.is_superuser == true
	msg := "SuperUser is not allow to launch jobs"
}

superuser_allowed_false := {
	"allowed": count(violations) == 0,
	"violations": violations,
}
```

The output of this policy checks whether the job was initiated by a superuser and returns `"allowed": false` with a violation message.

```json
{
  "allowed": false,
  "violations": [
    "SuperUser is not allow to launch jobs",
  ],
}
```

## Enforcement Behavior

This policy uses the `created_by.is_superuser` data to decide if the job execution is allowed. In this case, if the job is created by a superuser (platform admin) the job execution will ERROR. 

When applied at different enforcement points, the job execution is prevented accordingly:.

- **Job Template**: All jobs launched from the template by a superuser will **ERROR**, preventing playbook execution.
- **Inventory**: All jobs launched by a superuser using the inventory will **ERROR**, preventing playbook execution.
- **Organization**: All jobs launched by a superuser from templates belonging to  the organization will **ERROR**, blocking execution.

## Real World Use Case: Limiting Privileged Job Execution in Restricted Environments

### Scenario

In many organization with restricted or high security environments, itâ€™s common to apply internal policies that limit the use of privileged accounts. For example, platform administrators who manage and configure Ansible Automation Platform may not be permitted to launch automation jobs that impact production systems.

This approach supports governance models aligned with widely adopted principles like least privilege and separation of duties, commonly found in frameworks such as FedRAMP and ISO 27001.

## Impact of Policy Enforcement in Ansible Automation Platform

Enforcing this policy allows teams to add an additional layer of safety and accountability around who is permitted to run automation jobs.

## How AAP Enforces the Policy

When the SuperUser Block Policy (`superuser_allowed_false.rego`) is enforced:

- ðŸš« **Job Templates** - If a superuser attempts to launch a job from a protected job template, the job will immediately fail with an error, and the playbook will not execute.
- ðŸš« **Inventory** - Any job launched by a superuser that references an affected inventory will be blocked and result in an error.
- ðŸš« **Organization** - Job executions triggered by a superuser using job templates tied to a restricted organization will fail, preventing any automation from running.

## Why This Matters

- Helps enforce policies related to role separation and access control.
- Prevents privileged users from unintentionally running automation in sensitive environments.
- Offers a clear record of who can (and canâ€™t) launch jobs, supporting audit and compliance efforts.

With this policy in place, Ansible Automation Platform helps organizations establish clear operational boundaries and apply best practices focusing on those policies.
