# 4.Prevent job execution using credential with no Organization

Ansible Automation Platform provides a robust and highly customizable RBAC system, however no matter how much we try we are not able to meet every customer's unique need.

For example, Ansible Automation Controller allows you to create Credential that does not belong to an organization and can be use by any user and we have a RFE for prevent the use of these global credential in specific organization. This is not something that our current RBAC system will allow us to do and we can not think of a good way to make this happen.

With Policy as Code feature we achieve this easily.

Example policy [aap_policy_examples/global_credential_allowed_false.rego](aap_policy_examples/global_credential_allowed_false.rego):

```rego
package aap_policy_examples

# Find credentials with no organization
violating_credentials := {cred.name | cred := input.credentials[_]; cred.organization == null}

default global_credential_allowed_false := {"allowed": true}

# If any credential is violating, deny access and return violations
global_credential_allowed_false := {
	"allowed": false,
	"violations": sprintf(
		"Credential used in job execution does not belong to any org. Violating credentials: [%s]",
		[concat(", ", violating_credentials)],
	),
} if {
	count(violating_credentials) > 0
}

```

Example input:

```json
{
  "credential": [
    {
      "name": "Demo Credential",
      "description": "",
      "organization": null,
      "credential_type": 1,
      "managed": false,
      "inputs": {
          "username": "admin"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Example output:

```json
{
  "allowed": false,
  "violations": [
    "Credential used in job execution does not belong to any org"
  ]
}
```

When you apply this policy to an organization all job launch from that organization's inventory and job template will ERROR and prevent playbook execution.
