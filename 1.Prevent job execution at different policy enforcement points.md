# 1. Preventing Job Execution at Different Policy Enforcement Points

Ansible Automation Platform allows users to enforce policies at the Organization, Inventory, and Job Template levels.

This example demonstrates how to prevent job execution using OPA and Ansible Automation Platformâ€™s Policy as Code feature.

Example policy [aap_policy_examples/allowed_false.rego](aap_policy_examples/allowed_false.rego):

```rego
package aap_policy_examples

import rego.v1

allowed_false := {
	"allowed": false,
	"violations": ["No job execution is allowed"],
}
```

This policy does not take any input. It simply returns `"allowed": false` with a violation message explaining why the job is blocked.

When applied at different enforcement points, this policy prevents job execution accordingly:

- Job Template: All jobs launched from the template will ERROR and playbook execution will be prevented.
- Inventory: All jobs using the inventory will ERROR and playbook execution will be prevented.
- Organization: All jobs within the organization will ERROR and playbook execution will be prevented.
