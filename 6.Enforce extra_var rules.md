# 6. Enforce rules around extra_vars

Often the person who creates and maintains the automation in an organization is not the same person (or maybe even AI agent in the future) that launches the automation.

In Ansible Automation Platform adding "prompt on launch" for `extra_vars` are a flexible way for us to allow user that launches the automation to customize the job to their own specific need.

Currently `extra_vars` is implemented as a `JSONBlob` which means you can put whatever value you want in there with little to no way for the admin of the job template to control what can or can not be put in the extra_vars field.

This article will show a couple of ways that you can control `extra_vars` using the Policy as Code feature

## 6a: White list extra_vars

This example show how to limit what keys can be used in a job

Example policy [extra_vars_whitelist.rego](aap_policy_examples/extra_vars_whitelist.rego)

## 6b: Value validation for extra_vars

This example shows how to limit what values can be passed to an extra_var in a job

[extra_vars_validation.rego](aap_policy_examples/extra_vars_validation.rego)

## 6c: User based limitation for extra_vars

This is a more advance use case that shows how to limit what team of user can use what key and value in extra_vars
