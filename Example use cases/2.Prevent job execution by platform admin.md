# 2. Prevent job execution by platform admin

In previous example we looked at a trivial policy that does not take in any data, in this example we will demonstrate how to use data provided from Ansible Automation Platform to craft policy that makes decision base on the situation.


Example policy [policies/superuser-allowed-false.rego]:

```rego
package aap_policy_example

import rego.v1

violations contains msg if {
    input.created_by.is_superuser == true
    msg := "SuperUser is not allow to launch jobs"
}

response := {
    "allowed": count(violations) == 0,
    "violations": violations
}
```

Example input provided by Ansible Automation Platform during query:

```json
{
  "id": 785,
  "name": "Demo Job Template",
  "created": "2025-02-27T20:32:14.874821Z",
  "created_by": {
    "id": 1,
    "username": "admin",
    "is_superuser": true
  },
  ...
}

Example output from policy query:

```json
{
  "allowed": false,
  "violations": [
    "SuperUser is not allow to launch jobs",
  ],
}
```

This policy will use the `created_by.is_superuser` data from the input to decide if the job execution is `allowed` in this case if the job is created by an super user (platform admin) the job execution will be prevented.

When applied at different enforcement points, this policy prevents job execution accordingly:

- Job Template: All jobs launched from the template by an superuser will ERROR and playbook execution will be prevented.
- Inventory: All jobs launched by a superuser using the inventory will ERROR and playbook execution will be prevented.
- Organization: All jobs launched by a superuser using job template from the organization will ERROR and playbook execution will be prevented.

The Policy as Code feature in Ansible Automation Platform is capable of provided all relevant data around the job launch for more information around the `input` data that Ansible Automation Platform will provide for OPA policy query see [policy input data](POLICY_OUTPUT_DATA.md) for more detail.
